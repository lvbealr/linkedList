## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

A doubly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node contains a reference to both the next and the previous node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient traversal in both directions, making it versatile for various applications.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

### Clone Repository

What things you need to clone the repository to your own computer and .

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lvbealr/linkedList.git
cd linkedList/
```

### Build and Using

First of all, initialize submodule <b>CustomWarning</b>.

```bash
git submodule init customWarning
git submodule update
```

You can use <b>MAKE</b> to build the program and run it.

Enter the following command in the terminal:

```bash
make
```

Once compiled you can run the executable with the following command.

```bash
./build/list
```

The program will start in manual mode and ask you to enter data for correct operation.

## 🗎 Documentation <a name = "documentation"></a>

For convenient use of the program, [Doxygen documentation](https://lvbealr.github.io/) is included with the project.

## 🎈 Example Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The following functions are provided for working with a doubly linked list:

| Function       | Description                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `insertNode`   | Inserting a **new element** into a list |
| `deleteNode`   | **Removing** an item from a list        |
| `getNodeValue` | Returns the **value** of an element     |

## ⌛ GraphViz Dump <a name = "graphViz"></a>

To debug a doubly linked list, it is possible to create a graphic dump and save it in **.html** and **.svg** files
